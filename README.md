### 🛡️ SOC Fundamentals

**Room:** [SOC Fundamentals — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/socfundamentals)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *08 June 2025* 

### 🎯 Objective
Understand the role and structure of a Security Operations Center (SOC), focusing on the core responsibilities, team roles, and the pillars of People, Process, and Technology. Also practised performing triage on a real-world alert using a simulated SOC lab environment.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- **SOC (Security Operations Center)** — A dedicated team that monitors and defends an organisation’s systems 24/7.  
- **Detection and Response** — The main focus of the SOC: detect unauthorised activity, intrusions, and policy violations, then respond to them.  
- **People** — Different roles in the SOC (L1, L2, L3 Analysts, Security/Dengineers, SOC Manager) work together to handle alerts, incidents, and infrastructure.  
- **Process** — Steps followed by SOC teams, such as alert triage using the 5 Ws (What, When, Where, Who, Why), reporting, and incident response.  
- **Technology** — Tools like SIEM, EDR, and firewalls that enable detection, investigation, and automated response.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SIEM** — Used for centralised log analysis and rule-based alerting.  
- **EDR** — Endpoint-level monitoring and response with rich visibility.  
- **Firewall** — Filters network traffic and helps block threats before reaching internal systems.  
- **TryHackMe Lab** — Simulated alert analysis task acting as a Level 1 SOC Analyst.

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Took time to fully understand the SOC hierarchy and who handles what.
- Triage using the 5 Ws was a good framework, but identifying all the answers accurately required careful log analysis.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How SOC teams function in real life, from initial detection to escalation and resolution.
- Learned the difference between L1, L2, and L3 SOC roles, and how alerts are escalated.
- Understood how SIEM tools work behind the scenes to collect logs and trigger alerts.
- Realised that not all alerts are critical — triage is about prioritising properly.

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
> Understanding the SOC structure is key for anyone wanting to work in cyber defence. Roles like SOC Analyst are often entry-level in cyber security, and this room gave me a solid foundation on what to expect and how to think like an analyst when responding to threats.

---

### 💭 Reflections:
- This room helped confirm my interest in becoming a SOC Analyst. I enjoy structured response workflows and would like to keep building skills in log analysis and detection logic.
